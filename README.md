Sample code for using partials in handlebars

See the live demo here:
http://kahwee.github.io/handlebars-partials-sample/

I created a sample on how to use partials in Handlebars:
https://github.com/kahwee/handlebars-partials-sample

In the sample, Iâ€™m trying to make a really simple form framework through Handlebars.

It could possibly be used to generate forms. This is the fixture:
https://github.com/kahwee/handlebars-partials-sample/blob/gh-pages/js/fixtures.js

Using the templates here:
https://github.com/kahwee/handlebars-partials-sample/blob/gh-pages/index.html

We can generate this:

The sample code has a basic handlebars templating as well as precompiled handlebars.
